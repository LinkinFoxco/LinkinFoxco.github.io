## My Projects

### SOON ```(C++)```
[![image](https://raytracing.github.io/images/img-1.21-book1-final.jpg)](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
Scheduled for summer 2022, the project is on break, I prioritize my internship search on my free time.

### [Snapp'](https://www.snapp.fr/) ```(Java & Bash)```

At Snapp', I had the opportunity to work with a team and a researcher to realize [a SonarQube plugin](https://github.com/cnumr/ecoCode) allowing to analyze the ecodesign of a code.
\
First of all, I was assigned to the implementation of rules checking the presence of paterns and functions. I then focused on adding a language not supported by the technology. The plugin being oriented for mobile applications, the latter being nearly 15 billion in 2021, the support of different languages related to mobile development was a priority. SonarQube allows basic processing of Java but not Groovy or Kotlin. I then, based on existing projects, allowed the support of Groovy in SonarQube and its implementation in our plugin.\
\
Afterwards, I worked on a project of security analysis and lint to be automated in the CI. Working on many open source projects, allowing to cover the 11 languages used in the agency as well as Bash scripting, I developed then implemented, with the system administrator, the launching of various processes via Kubernetes in the Gitlab then their exploitation in an automatic review creation system as well as a graphical interface realized by a peer.

### [Le Comptoir des Cybermonnaies](https://www.lecomptoirdescybermonnaies.fr/) ```(VBA)```

At Le Comptoir des Cybermonnaies I realized different **IT** tasks but especially **Dev** on the internal tool over a period of 4 months.\
I was able to learn the **VBA** mainly used on the tool.\
I was confronted with problems related to the treatment of customers as well as compliance, which allowed me to acquire skills in the **financial** and **legislative** field in addition to those of a developer.\
Unfortunately, I can't share the tool.

### [ Image To DMC](https://github.com/LinkinFoxco/Image-To-DMC) ```(C#)```

Small personal project, it is a gift made for a member of my family.\
The software allows to convert an image into an indexed grid corresponding to a list of colored beads.\
The code simply matches an array of RGB values to the index of the pearl and then generates an image.\
It allowed me to start in C# with a basic graphical interface.

### [Web Project A2](https://github.com/LinkinFoxco/ProjetWebA2) ```(HTML/CSS JS PHP)```

First web experience with a goal to recreate a LinkedIn **clone** in a short time.\
We used a **Laravel** framework and its **Blade** engine.\
The architecture is mostly in php and therefore a lot of **backend** processing.\
The realization of the latter did not particularly fascinate me but it remains an interesting experience.

### [Embedded System](https://github.com/LinkinFoxco/ProjetsVrac/blob/main/ProjetSysEmbarqu%C3%A9Final.ino) ```(C++)```

The objective was to answer a fictitious request for an embedded weather station on boats.\
Made on arduino, it's a project that I particularly liked, the goal being to use the least amount of space as well as the fastest processing possible, in short optimization.\
Some electronic problems but the main part of the work was the use of classes and pointers to optimize data processing and storage.

### [Projet POO](https://github.com/LinkinFoxco/ProjetPOO/tree/master/ProjetPOO) ```(C++)```

Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in a commercial software context.\
It allowed us to understand the good practices of software design as well as relational databases with a need analysis and a MCD.
